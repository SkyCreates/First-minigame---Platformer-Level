# Basic Platformer Game Level

Welcome to my first game level development project, crafted during and beyond a tutorial from UNF Games Gamedev Quest. This level is inspired by classic platformer games and is designed to challenge both the player's platforming skills and their problem-solving abilities through a series of color-based puzzles.

## Key Features:
- **Collectables**: Players can gather coins and various colored keys (blue, red, yellow, and black) throughout the level.
- **Color-Based Gates**: These keys are used to unlock corresponding colored gates. Additionally, players can combine keys (like blue and red to open purple gates) to advance, testing their understanding of color combinations.
- **Immersive Camera System**: Enhances the playing experience by dynamically adjusting to the player's movements and actions.
- **Basic UI Elements**: Includes essential user interface features to guide the player through the level.
- **Executable for Windows**: Easily downloadable and playable version for Windows users.

This game level is a small but significant step towards my larger goal of creating immersive, open-world games. Your feedback and suggestions are highly valuable as they will help me refine my skills and expand my development capabilities.
